# webpack-boilerplate-Fall-2019
A React Webpack to use as a Boilerplate. It is from early Fall 2019 for reference and updates. When you download it, you can run yarn init to put your own information in the package.json file, then you can run yarn install. Then run yarn run build. Running yarn start or yarn run dev will start it up. I also run yarn audit often to make sure it is all working.

This webpack was made using this site https://www.valentinog.com/blog/webpack/ (thank you Valentino Gagliardi) and yarn. The webpack is set up to support HTML, CSS, Images, and routing if needed. I used the following commands in this order when I made it in the first place:

cd <into the file where I will place my project>
mkdir <whatever I decide to call this file> && cd <whatever I decide to call this file>
yarn init
yarn add webpack --dev
yarn add webpack-cli --dev
mkdir src && touch src/index.js
yarn run build
yarn run dev
yarn run build
yarn add @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env --dev
touch .babelrc
touch webpack.config.js
yarn run build
yarn add react react-dom --dev
yarn add @babel/preset-react --dev
touch src/App.js
yarn run build
yarn audit
yarn add html-webpack-plugin html-loader --dev
src/index.html
yarn run build
yarn add mini-css-extract-plugin css-loader --dev
touch src/main.css
yarn run build
yarn add webpack-dev-server --dev
yarn add file-loader --dev  
yarn add image-webpack-loader --dev
yarn run build  
yarn run dev 
yarn start  

Sometimes it will not start without yarn run dev being run first. I also ran the command 'yarn audit' when building the webpack to see if the packages are up to date and running well.
